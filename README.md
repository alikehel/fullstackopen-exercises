# [Full Stack Open 2022](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) Exercices

Learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, TypeScript, React Native, GitHub Actions and Docker in one go! This course will introduce you to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

> This repository contains my solutions for the exercises from the Course Full Stack, held by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki, Finland.
